# Game-Project-Thing

Concept:
Randomly generated infinite side scrolling platformer game

Levels:
Levels randomly generated, but each level increases difficulty by decreasing number of platforms available, making platforms smaller, increasing enemies, increasing the speed at which everything moves
Platforms must appear within a certain radius of another platform, determined by maximum possible reach of player based on platform speed and jump height
Ceiling is a wall
Levels last for two minutes

Lives:
Each player has 3 lives
When a player loses a life, they spawn on a newly appearing platform
Enemies either sit on parts of platform or fly across screen
Players lose lives when they touch an enemy or touch the floor
Players gain a life after the end of a level, up to a maximum of 3 lives
Player loses after losing all 3 lives

Items:
Power ups include double jumps and invincibility for 5 seconds
Power ups randomly generated at random intervals, when collected are stored to be used
Additional coins to be collected in random places
